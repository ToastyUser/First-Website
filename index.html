    </summary>
I want to start up a website where android/ios/pc/ect. users can submit there video game ideals, i realized there really isnt a board to submit your ideals, so i did not want to see YOUR video game ideals go to waste and just be a dream! 
</br>
<div p style="font-size:13px; color:gray;"> <b>PS.</b>This will have a ton of typo's as i will go back and fix then! 
for now i am focusing on the website itself first before polish or correction issues i will fix it as i go! </div>

    </summary>
<!--As i mentioned the big company issue...there concern was that everyones ideal was the same! now i see this as a positive we can all agree on one thing and that is <b>our</b> ideals, now i want to do my best to avoid creating the same ideals and seeing duplicates for the same ideals on these games, how would we do this? 
copy and paste for my other lines
<details>
    <summary p style="font-size:25px"><b></b>
<ul>
    <li>Duplicate ideals</li>
    <li>overwhelming ideals that could ruin a project</li>
    <li>communication between the community(bullying, harassment, ect)</li>
    <li>communication between the ideals, boards.</li>
</ul>

A temporary solution will be used until a much more suitable one comes up! for now i will go based on how i see this website to function for the community as a whole! -->
As i will accept any and all feedback for improvement and     what can be improved, your opinion matters to me!
now lets get to it! 


What is this community for? 
<b>IDEALS</b> meaning if it is not related to a video game ideal or a ideal itself relating to the project or dream you want to see then it will <b>NOT</b> be published! 
</br> </br>

As you should be aware by now this website is strictly for video game project based ideals to bring us dreamers and inspired people together anything but that will not allowed to be posted! 
</br> </br>

Another thing i noticed was that other people on it's own was worse than the companys reaction to such a question "where can i post my ideals for my video game?" majority of communities replied back with trash all your ideals are trash, i don't see it like that what about inventors they had a ideal didn't they? what about Minecraft and halo they were ideals to!
</br> </br>

Now that we understand the reaction of other communities, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THAT HERE! every ideal is a GOOD ideal, yeah it may be a duplicate but i will not accept any form of harassment, bullying, or negative post, comments, or replies,ect if you have nothing nice to say just don't say it! it's as simple as that.
</br>



<h2><b>Duplicate ideals issue</b></h2>
When a person creates a post with there ideal it won't post until approved in order to truly block out duplication ideals, the approval process would only take about 5-10 minutes to be looked at and approved!
</br> </br>

That solves the duplication ideals for now, but what about bullying and communication between the people on the board itself?
</br>





<h2><b>Dealing With Bullying</b></h2>
You will receive a strict one time warning! as mentioned above,<b> I Do Not accepted bullying, harassment, or any other shape or form of negative contributors! </b> </br> <br />
Please do not reply back to said negative person and simply report it by contacting the moderators! </br> <br />
Moderators will do there best to respond back within 5-15 minutes as these emails will be on high priority! </br> <br />
<b>If said moderator does not respond back within 15 minutes do not hesitate to </b>

<a href = "mailto: fkratsweb@gmail.com?subject = Feedback&body = Message">contact me directly!</a>
<br />







<h2><b>Overwheling ideals solution</b></h2>
Try to boil your ideal down to the core fundamentals of what you want, make your vision as simple as possible, please try to refrain from a 6 paragraph essay about what you want and don't want in your ideal, just simply mention the core mechanics and maybe a background for more information if needed!
</details>


<details>
    <summary p style="font-size:25px"><b>How the website will act</b> 
    </summary>
I plan on having the website be where you can submit your project ideals onto a sticky note and slap that baby onto the community board for everyone to see, that will be where your simplied core concept will be, if you scroll down there will be containing more detailed information about your project or ideal! <br /> <br />

Mods will be in charge to watch over the website to delete any and all spam that comes through the website! </br> 
</details>



<details>
    <summary p style="font-size:25px"><b>How to submit your ideals</b> 
    </summary>
Unfortunately user submissions will have to go through moderators <b>at this time</b> so if you have a ideal you'll need to send a email, or contact them through the provided information below! </br> <br />

<a href = "mailto: fkratsweb@gmail.com?subject = Feedback&body = Message">
Contact Us!
</a>

But don't let this discourage you from submitting any ideals! Any and all video game ideals will be reviewed & accepted!
